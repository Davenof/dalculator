  The calculator is meant to be a multi-purpose calculator with functionalities that are beyond basic arithmetic. Hence, the final goal is to have a calculator that computes complex mathematical and statistical problems.

  At Version 1.0 however, the calculator performs basic multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and a few other mathematical functions correctly, but does not display the operators performing the math. That notwithstanding, visible operators will feature in later versions.
